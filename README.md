# Fresh To Market
*Fresh to Market* is a project inspired by the concept of selling fresh produce to people in need. The main function of this project is to utilize bootstrap to make a responsive website that can function and look good on all different screen sizes. The project features an option to search for select items, a way for a user to log in, sign up, and even an option to add items to your cart and clear your cart.

## Installation
To install and run this project, make a clone of the project. Once the project is on your computer, simply double click on index.html.


## Usage
This project offers a couple of options in how it can be used. One option is to log out which will then bring you to the login page, from there you can enter random information for login to return to the home page or you can even sign up or retrieve your password through a form. You can click on items to add them to your cart and you can click on the account icon to empty your cart. The search bar is functional in the sense you can enter one of the following options, "deals", "seasonal", "fruits", or "veggies". Inputting one of these will bring you to view all pages of the entered name.

A special thanks to my professor for giving me great tips and ideas for this project. He guided me through this month and showed me best practices to adhere to. This project wouldn't be the same without his support.
